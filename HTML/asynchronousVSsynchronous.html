    asynchronous and synchrounous programming difference basics.

    1.synchrounous programming means basically means we have to wait for the entire time until the first task is done for execution of second task.
    2.asynchronous programming means we can specify some task inside the setTimeOut function so that the browser knows that the previous work will be done so it goes for the next task to execute that.
    by this we do not have to wait for the first task to get fully completed for starting the another task.
