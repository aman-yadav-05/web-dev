        // let us create random this is very important. By default .Random will create random no. between 0 and 1

        // there are also two fun. floor and ceil ceil gives you upper value and floor gives you lower value 2.3 ceil will be 3 and floor will be 2
        // we can use pow to get the power val lieke 2 power 3
        console.log(Math.pow(2,3)) //that is 8.
